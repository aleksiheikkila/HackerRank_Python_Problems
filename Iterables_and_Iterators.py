# You are given a list of N lowercase English letters. 
# For a given integer K, you can select any K indices 
# (assume 1-based indexing) with a uniform probability from the list.

# Find the probability that at least one of the  indices selected will contain the letter: 'a'.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
